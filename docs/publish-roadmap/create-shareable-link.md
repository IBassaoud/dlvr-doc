# Creating a Shareable Link

In Dlvr, you can create a shareable link for your roadmap. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to your board.
2. Click on the "**Request Edit**" button at the top to toggle to edit mode.
3. Enter the digit code when prompted.
4. If the code is valid, a "**Publish**" button will appear at the bottom.
5. Click on the "**Publish**" button.

After performing these steps, a shareable link will be displayed on the screen. You can share this link with anyone who needs to follow the roadmap.

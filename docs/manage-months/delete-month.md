# Delete a Month

In Dlvr, you have the ability to **delete a month** when it's no longer needed. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to your board.
2. Hover over the month you want to delete.
3. Click on the "**x**" button that appears.

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={require("./img/delete-month.png").default} alt="Locate plus button" style={{width: "35%", borderRadius: "10px", boxShadow: "0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 3px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)"}} />
</div>

4. Confirm your decision to delete the month.

After deleting a month, it will be removed from your board along with its sprints and tickets.

:::danger
Ensure you move all the tickets from the month you want to delete to another month before proceeding with the deletion. If not, the tickets will be permanently lost.

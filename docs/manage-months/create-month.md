# Create a Month

In Dlvr, a **month** serves as a time frame within your board, allowing you to plan your sprints and tickets. Here's how you can create a new month:

1. Navigate to your board.

2. Locate the "**+**" button at the right end of the month container.

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
  <img src={require("./img/add-month.png").default} alt="Locate plus button" style={{width: "70%", borderRadius: "10px", boxShadow: "0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 3px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)"}} />
</div>

3. Click the "**+**" button. This action will automatically generate the next month for you.

Once a month is created, it will appear on your board, pre-populated with two default sprints and tickets. You can now begin to add more tickets or update the existing ones as per your requirements.

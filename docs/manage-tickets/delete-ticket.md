# Delete a Ticket

In Dlvr, you have the ability to delete a ticket when it's no longer necessary. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to your board.
2. Select the ticket you wish to delete.
3. Click on the "**Delete**" button, represented by the bin icon at the bottom left.
4. Confirm your decision to delete the ticket.

Upon deleting a ticket, it will be permanently removed from your board.

Please proceed with caution when deleting a ticket. This action is irreversible, and the ticket cannot be retrieved once deleted. Ensure you have considered all implications before performing this task.

2. Click on the "**Notify subscribers ðŸ“©**" button at the bottom.
3. A dialog window will appear prompting you to describe the changes made.
4. Enter the description of the changes.
5. Click "**Send**".

After performing these steps, an email notification describing the changes will be sent to all subscribers of the roadmap.

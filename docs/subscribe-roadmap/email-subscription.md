# Email Notifications for Changes

In Dlvr, you can **subscribe** to a roadmap to receive email notifications for changes. Here's how you can do it:

1. Head over to the roadmap you're interested in.
2. Make sure you're not in edit mode. You should see an input box at the bottom of the roadmap.
3. Type in your email address in that box.
4. Hit the "**Subscribe**" button.

After subscribing, a notification will pop up at the bottom of the screen confirming your successful subscription. If you're already subscribed, it'll let you know that too.

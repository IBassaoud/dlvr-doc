# Create a Ticket

In Dlvr, a **ticket** represents a task or a piece of work that needs to be accomplished. Here's how you can create a new ticket:

1. Navigate to your board.
2. Locate the "**+**" button at the bottom of the sprint container and click on it.
3. Enter a **title** for your ticket.
4. Provide a **description** for your ticket.
5. Set the **priority** level for your ticket.
6. If applicable, enter a **link** related to your ticket.
7. Click "**Validate**".

Upon creating a ticket, it will be displayed on your board. You now have the ability to drag and drop it into any month you prefer. Additionally, you can update the ticket or delete it if it's no longer necessary.

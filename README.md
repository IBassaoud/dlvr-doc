## Installation

To get started with Dlvr, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check the necessary requirements [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#requirements). Once you have these prerequisites, you can install Dlvr by first cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBassaoud/dlvr-doc.git
```

Then navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd dlvr-doc
```

And install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the Dlvr application in your local development environment, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Once you run the start command, it initiates a local development server and automatically opens up a browser window. The server is configured to reflect most changes live, eliminating the need for manual restarts.

If everything is set up correctly (it always does ðŸ˜Š), the Dlvr website will be accessible at: [http://localhost:3000/dlvr-doc/](http://localhost:3000/dlvr-doc/)

Have fun !
